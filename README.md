# Computational Metabolomics Project

This project is part of the course Statistical Learning and focuses on reproducing a complete and statistically rigorous metabolomics analysis pipeline using the dataset from Fan et al. (2018):  
*Sex-associated differences in baseline urinary metabolites of healthy adults* (Scientific Reports, 2018).

The analysis is based on the supplementary file MOESM2 (ESM), which contains GC–TOF–MS metabolomic measurements for 120 urine samples (60 males, 60 females).

The objective is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature significance testing, supervised modeling (PLS-DA), feature selection, and external validation with uncertainty quantification in order to characterize sex-related metabolic differences.

## 1. Import Data

- Loaded GC–TOF–MS metabolomics dataset from `41598_2018_29592_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx`.
- Extracted sex labels (Male/Female) from metadata rows.
- Removed metadata columns and retained only metabolite intensities.
- Ensured all metabolite values were numeric and stored in matrix format.
- Final dataset contains 120 samples (60 males, 60 females) and several hundred metabolites.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 2.1 Summary Statistics
- Inspected metabolite distributions (mean, median, range).
- Counted zero values and missing values across the dataset.

### 2.2 Distribution Assessment
- Raw metabolite intensities showed strong right-skewness.
- QQ-plots confirmed non-Gaussian distributions.

### 2.3 Zero Handling
- Zero values replaced by half of the minimum non-zero value per metabolite, allowing log10 transformation without introducing infinite values.

### 2.4 Log Transformation
- Applied log10(x) transformation to stabilize variance and reduce skewness.

### 2.5 Autoscaling
- All metabolites mean-centered and scaled to unit variance to ensure comparability in multivariate analyses.

### 2.6 Outlier Detection
- Performed PCA combined with Hotelling’s T² ellipse (95% CI).
- Detected 9 potential outliers.
- No samples were removed to avoid biological bias and to remain consistent with the original study, which analyzed all subjects.

## 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 3.1 PCA Computation
- Performed PCA on log-transformed and autoscaled data with samples as rows and metabolites as columns.

### 3.2 PCA Score Plot
- PC1 vs PC2 revealed moderate sex-related trends.
- Outliers highlighted using Mahalanobis distance.

### 3.3 Scree Plot
- Typical metabolomics behavior observed.
- PC1–PC2 explain approximately 20–30% of the total variance.

### 3.4 Interpretation
- Although unsupervised, PCA already suggests subtle sex-related structure.
- Variability is considered biologically meaningful rather than noise.

## 4. Supervised Analysis (PLS-DA & Validation)

### 4.1 Train/Test Split
- Performed a stratified 70/30 split preserving Male/Female proportions.
- Training set used for model building and feature selection.
- Test set reserved exclusively for external validation.

### 4.2 Initial PLS-DA Model
- Trained an initial PLS-DA model with 10 latent variables.
- Score plot showed clear discrimination between males and females.

### 4.3 Internal Validation (5-Fold Cross-Validation)
- Evaluated models with 1–5 latent variables.
- AUC-ROC used as the primary performance metric.
- Optimal number of components: 3 (highest mean AUC and best generalization).

### 4.4 Final PLS-DA Model
- Retrained the PLS-DA model using 3 latent variables.
- Reduced model complexity while maintaining discriminatory power.

### 4.5 External Validation (Test Set)
- Predicted sex labels for the held-out test set.
- Computed:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Accuracy
  - Balanced Error Rate (BER)
  - ROC curve and AUC
- Results confirmed a strong and reproducible sex-related metabolic signal.

## 5. Univariate Analysis

### 5.1 Statistical Testing
- Applied Welch’s t-tests to each metabolite on the training set only.
- Corrected for multiple testing using FDR (Benjamini–Hochberg).

### 5.2 Effect Size
- Computed mean differences (Male – Female) for each metabolite.

### 5.3 Volcano Plot
- Generated volcano plot displaying:
  - Effect size vs statistical significance
  - Metabolites with FDR < 0.05
  - Direction of sex-associated changes

### 5.4 Interpretation
- Identified 9 statistically significant metabolites.
- These features represent candidate biomarkers and inputs for subsequent feature selection.

---

## 6. Feature Selection

### 6.1 VIP Score Ranking
- Computed Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores from the PLS-DA model.
- Ranked metabolites according to their contribution to class discrimination.
- Visualized the top-ranked metabolites and applied the conventional VIP > 1 threshold.

### 6.2 Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Implemented RFE using a k-NN classifier with repeated 5-fold cross-validation.
- Evaluated classification accuracy across different feature subset sizes.
- Selected the optimal subset of metabolites maximizing cross-validated accuracy.

## 7. Final Model with Optimal Features

### 7.1 Model Training
- Subset the training and test sets to the optimal RFE-selected features.
- Trained a final PLS-DA model using:
  - Optimal number of latent variables (3)
  - Optimal feature subset

### 7.2 External Validation
- Evaluated the final model on the independent test set.
- Computed:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Accuracy
  - Balanced Error Rate (BER)
  - Cohen’s Kappa
  - ROC curve and AUC

## 8. Figure of Merit Uncertainty

### 8.1 Bootstrap Analysis
- Quantified uncertainty of performance metrics using nonparametric bootstrap resampling (n = 1000) applied to the test set.
- Metrics evaluated:
  - Accuracy
  - BER
  - Cohen’s Kappa
  - Sensitivity and specificity for both sexes
  - AUC-ROC

### 8.2 Confidence Intervals
- Reported mean estimates and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for all figures of merit.
- Results demonstrate robust performance and stable generalization of the final model.
