# Computational Metabolomics Project

This project is part of the course Statistical Learning and focuses on reproducing a complete metabolomics analysis pipeline using the dataset from **Fan et al. (2018)**:
Sex-associated differences in baseline urinary metabolites of healthy adults (Scientific Reports, 2018).
The analysis is based on the supplementary file MOESM2 (ESM), which contains GC–TOF–MS metabolomic measurements for 120 urine samples (60 males, 60 females).
The goal is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature significance testing, and supervised modeling (PLS-DA) to characterize metabolic differences between sexes.
